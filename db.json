But I’m 14, and I’m horny, and I want so much to be kissed. I want to know what another mouth tastes like. My jaw works in a sloppy approximation of kissing toward this void, this empty face. When I’m alone in my room I sometimes rub my lips and tongue against the back of my hand, imagining the taste of someone else’s skin.",
